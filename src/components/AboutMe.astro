      My name is Ignacio Perrote, although my friends call me Nacho. I am from
      Córdoba, Argentina, and currently live in Valencia, Spain. I started my
      programming career in 2023 when I had the opportunity to train and
      collaborate at my brother's development company, Bigdogs 🐶. I am
      currently <strong
        >seeking a new challenge where I can leverage my knowledge 🚀</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my projects include <strong>creating modals or components</strong>
      in already initiated applications and
      <strong>developing and testing websites</strong> from scratch.
